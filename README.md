# Learn You Node

Lesson from [http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers](http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers)

You’ll need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) on your computer to get started with each of these. Then use [npm](http://npmjs.org/) (it comes with Node) to install each module with the command below it. Once installed, simply type the workshopper’s name to launch.

You will also need a Text Editor, if you don't have one already, you may want one for editing code. A few options: [Atom](http://www.atom.io/), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), [Textmate](http://macromates.com/download), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).

Next from Terminal type `npm install -g learnyounode` and press return. Then type `learnyounode` and press return.

My personal soltuons are provided in the folders of this repository. Enjoy!
